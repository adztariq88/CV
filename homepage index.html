        <h3><strong><u>English Teacher</u> </strong></h3>
        <p>As an experienced English teacher and international business graduate,
          I can communicate well at all levels and ages. <br />Being creative with the use of
          information technology and classroom activities to construct a fun learning
          environment is one of my passions. <br />Mature and lively, I have a variety of
          hobbies especially in sports and I’m committed to improving my teaching
          skills as well as contributing to the success of the school, I work in.</p>
